## Logging Into ieng6
<img src="Images/ieng6-login.png" height = "700" width = "800" />
First, ssh into the remote server by typing:
`ssh cs15lwi23xxx@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
This is already assuming you've completed the earlier steps of setting up a ssh key to avoid
having to type the password all over again.

## Cloning the fork of the Repository
Next, retrieve the ssh url of the file you're trying to clone from the forked repository. Refer
to the image below:
