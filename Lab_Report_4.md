First, ssh into the remote server by typing: `ssh cs15lwi23xxx@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. This is already assuming you've completed the earlier steps of setting up a ssh key to avoid having to type the password all over again. Remember the `xxx` is your own privately assigned letters.

## 2. Cloning the fork of the Repository
Next, retrieve the ssh url of the file you're trying to clone from the forked repository. Refer
